//base weapon class
//equipable by enemies and player
//probably has a rigidbody and collidor when dropped
//when equiped disable rigidbody and collider things.

//e.g. a behemoth will carry a sword differently than a humanoid.

//still not sure if game logic and display logic are tied here.
// especially once we tie in animation
